# Air Quality Index (AQI) Analysis – India (2015–2025)

## 📌 Project Overview
Air pollution is one of the most critical environmental and public health challenges in India.  
This project analyzes **Air Quality Index (AQI) data from 2015 to 2025** to identify long-term trends, regional disparities, pollutant dominance, and seasonal patterns across Indian states and cities.

Using **Power BI**, raw environmental data is transformed into an interactive, insight-driven dashboard that supports data-driven understanding for policy analysis, urban planning, and public health awareness.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Analyze AQI trends across years, states, and cities
- Classify air quality using standard AQI categories
- Identify dominant pollutants affecting air quality
- Compare air quality levels across regions
- Highlight high-risk periods and locations
- Build an interactive and professional Power BI dashboard

---

## 📊 Dashboard Highlights
- **Dynamic AQI Gauge** showing current AQI, category, and severity
- **State-wise AQI comparison** using map visualization
- **AQI category distribution** (Good → Hazardous)
- **Pollutant dominance analysis** (PM2.5, PM10, O₃, NO₂, etc.)
- **Time-series AQI trends** by year and month
- Interactive slicers for **Year, State, and Area**

## 🧪 AQI Classification Used
| AQI Range | Category |
|---------|---------|
| 50–100 | Good |
| 101–150 | Moderate |
| 151–200 | Poor |
| 201–250 | Unhealthy |
| 251–300 | Very Unhealthy |
| 301+ | Hazardous |

## 📈 Key Insights
- Northern states consistently record **higher AQI levels**, especially during winter months.
- **PM2.5** is the dominant pollutant across most regions.
- AQI peaks sharply during **November–January**, indicating strong seasonal patterns.
- Significant disparity exists between metropolitan and coastal regions.
- Long-term trends indicate persistent air quality challenges across major urban areas.
